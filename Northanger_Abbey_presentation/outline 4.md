**Introduction:** 

Hello everyone, today we will present our analysis on the film adaptation of Jane Austen's "Northanger Abbey." 
Our focus will be on an exploration of Catherine's character portrayal, particularly the conflict between fantasy and reality, and the divergent themes in the movie and the novel.

**Content:** 
Our presentation is divided into two main parts:
The first part is:
Exploring Catherine's character portrayal and her conflict between fantasy and reality.
While the second part is: 
Analysis of the divergent themes in movie and novel.


First, let's discuss the themes presented in the movie adaptation.

As my partner previously discussed, the film brilliantly uses visual and auditory elements to enhance the Gothic atmosphere present in the novel. This effectively highlights how deeply Catherine is obsessed with the Gothic novels she reads.

Furthermore, the film employs a more direct and explicit approach to showcase Catherine's transition and growth from imagination to reality.

A key scene in the novel, where Henry Tilney gently but firmly corrects Catherine's wild suspicions, is altered in the film. In the book, Henry’s speech appeals to Catherine’s understanding and sense of the probable. However, in the movie, his rebuke is more pointed, emphasizing the dangers of letting her imagination run wild and explicitly stating that she reads too many novels.

Another symbolic scene added in the film shows Catherine throwing her copy of "Udolpho" into the fire. This dramatic gesture, not present in the book, suggests a more emphatic rejection of her previous fantasies and marks a significant moment in her character development.
