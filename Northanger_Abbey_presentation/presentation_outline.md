# Comparison of "Northanger Abbey" in Novel and Film Adaptations

Today, I will talk about the differences between Jane Austen's "Northanger Abbey" and its film adaptation, focusing on how both mediums portray Catherine's growth from fantasy to reality.

## Introduction:

Catherine is an imaginative young girl whose obsession with gothic fiction leads her to many fantasies and misconceptions about the real world. When she visits Northanger Abbey for the first time, her mind is filled with anticipation of mystery and horror stories.

## Catherine's Fantasies and Misunderstandings:

Mistakenly believing that the abbey hides gothic novel-like secrets, Catherine looks forward to discovering shadowy corridors, secret rooms, and hidden crimes in the ancient castle. This is evident when she finds a common chest in her room, interpreting it as a potential hiding place for secrets. Additionally, from later passages, we see her disappointment that Northanger Abbey is too bright and ordinary, contrasting sharply with her gothic imaginations. She even suspects General Tilney of hiding something about his wife's death and fantasizes that he may be a murderer.

## The Impact of Novels:

These plots illustrate how over-indulgence in fiction can lead to a misunderstanding of reality, a dominant view of novels at the time. Samuel Johnson, the author of "Tom Jones," once said: “The rational requirement of fiction is the dissemination of truth,” reflecting the belief that supernatural elements in gothic novels did not positively affect readers. However, Jane Austen supports the idea that novels can influence readers to explore and understand the world. Through the contrast between gothic novel plots and Northanger Abbey, Catherine not only matures but
also demonstrates the positive impact of reading fiction. She begins to understand that while fictional plots are exciting, they should not replace real-life understanding and judgment.

## Catherine's Growth:

Illusions are not enduring and gradually shatter as one's knowledge of the world increases. When Henry exposes Catherine’s fantasies, she feels shame and disappointment. These painful experiences are essential to growing up, leaving a strong impression. This process reflects her self-examination of her fantasies and exercises her judgment. This realization contributes to her growth from a fantastical girl to a more rational and mature woman.

## Film Adaptation:

The movie's portrayal of Catherine's upbringing is much more vivid. Upon first entering Northanger Abbey, the film uses dimly lit and gloomy scenes, with music enhancing the mystery to emphasize gothic elements and Catherine's fantasies. As the story progresses, the tone and atmosphere shift from gothic fantasy to brightness and reality. For example, when Catherine discovers that the items in the chest are just ordinary
household items, the film uses bright lighting and calming music to symbolize her return to reality.

## Comparison of Mediums:

This exemplifies the difference between a movie and a novel. A novel uses a character's internal monologue to reveal their personality, whereas a movie translates this into visual and auditory representations, making it easier for the audience to understand Catherine's mental state.

## Conclusion:

In conclusion, Catherine's journey from fantasy to reality highlights the contrasting impacts of novels and their adaptations. Through her experiences, both in the book and the film, we see the maturation process that balances imagination with the understanding of reality.
